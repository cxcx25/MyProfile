Ahh yep — this screenshot helps a lot 👍
This is not a missing image problem. It’s a desktop scaling / container sizing issue.

What’s happening:

On mobile, the image looks fine because the container height adapts.

On desktop, the image is being stretched / zoomed / cropped badly, so you’re seeing those huge blurred diamonds.

This almost always comes from background-size + fixed height or an <img> without object-fit.

Let’s fix it properly.

What’s causing it (very likely)

You’re using one of these patterns:

Case A – CSS background-image
.hero {
  background-image: url("...");
  height: 300px;   /* ❌ fixed height */
}


OR

Case B – <img> inside a container
<div class="hero">
  <img src="..." />
</div>


with CSS like:

.hero img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;   /* ❌ stretches image */
}


On desktop, the container gets wide, but height stays fixed → image zooms like crazy.

✅ THE FIX (pick the one that matches your setup)
✅ Fix 1: If this is a background image (most likely)

Use this exact combo:

.hero {
  background-image: url("./images/hero.png");
  background-size: cover;        /* key */
  background-position: center;   /* key */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;

  min-height: 300px;             /* not height */
}


❌ Remove:

height: 300px;

Why this works

cover fills the area without distortion

center keeps it visually balanced

min-height allows it to grow naturally

✅ Fix 2: If this is an <img> tag

Use object-fit (this is the big one people miss):

.hero img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;     /* 🔥 magic line */
  object-position: center;
}


And make sure the parent has a height:

.hero {
  height: 300px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

✅ Fix 3: Different behavior for desktop vs mobile (best UX)

Since you already said mobile is fine, do this:

.hero {
  background-size: contain;
  background-position: center;
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .hero {
    background-size: cover;
    min-height: 350px;
  }
}


This prevents desktop from over-zooming.

🔍 Quick debug (2 minutes)

On desktop:

Right-click the image → Inspect

Select the container

Look for:

height: XXXpx

background-size: 100% 100%

img { height: 100% }

If you see any of those, that’s the culprit.

💡 Pro tip (portfolio polish)

That image looks like a pattern, not a hero photo.
Patterns usually look better with:

background-size: contain;
background-repeat: repeat;


instead of cover.
