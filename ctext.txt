The console errors you're seeing (especially net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND on multiple .jpg files like picb02.jpg, picb03.jpg, etc., plus the previous 503 / syntax errors on JS) are the direct reason your website shows only a purple background with no text or content visible.
Why This Happens

Your page is trying to load images (likely background images, profile photo, or section icons) from paths like /picb02.jpg, /picb03.jpg, etc.
These files do not exist in your GitHub repo (or are in the wrong location), so GitHub Pages returns 404 → browser treats it as "file not found".
More critically: Your page uses JavaScript (jQuery + plugins like scrolllex, main/util.js) to reveal/hide/show the actual text content (your name, summary, nav links, sections).
When those JS files fail to load (due to wrong paths or missing files), jQuery never initializes → $ / jQuery is undefined → scroll animations, fade-ins, or content toggles never run.
Result: The HTML text stays hidden (probably styled with opacity: 0, display: none, or positioned off-screen until JS "activates" it).


The purple background loads because it's simple CSS (no dependency on broken resources), but everything else is blocked by these failed loads.
How to Fix It (Step-by-Step)

Confirm Missing Files in Repo
Go to https://github.com/cxcx25/MyProfile
Look inside: There is no folder like images/, pics/, or files named picb02.jpg, picb03.jpg, etc. (your repo has images/ folder but it's empty or doesn't contain these).
Same for JS: No assets/js/jquery.min.js, jquery.scrolllex.min.js, main.js, etc. visible in the root listing.
→ These files are either not committed/pushed, or the paths in index.html don't match the actual repo structure.

Fix Image Paths (Quick Test)
Open your local index.html (C:/Users/josephmarilla/Documents/Project/Profile/index.html)
Search for lines like:HTML<img src="picb02.jpg">   or   background-image: url('picb03.jpg');
These paths assume the images are in the same folder as index.html.
Change to correct relative paths based on your repo:
If images are in /images/ folder in repo → use src="./images/picb02.jpg"
Or upload the actual jpg files to the repo's images/ folder via GitHub web or git push.

Commit & push → wait 1–2 min → refresh live site.

Fix JavaScript Loading (This Will Bring Back Your Text)
In index.html, find all <script src="..."> tags (probably near the bottom or in <head>).
Common broken patterns:
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script> → file missing → 404 → syntax error when browser tries to parse the 404 HTML response as JS.
<script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> → leading / means root of domain → wrong on GitHub Pages.

Temporary quick fix (use CDNs to bypass local files):
Replace your jQuery lines with:HTML<!-- jQuery CDN -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>

<!-- If using plugins like scrollTo / scrolllex, find CDN or remove if not essential -->
<!-- Example for a common one: -->
<!-- <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-scrollTo/2.1.3/jquery.scrollTo.min.js"></script> -->
Remove or comment out broken local scripts for now:HTML<!-- <script src="assets/js/jquery.scrolllex.min.js"></script> -->
<!-- <script src="assets/js/main.js"></script> -->
If your page has custom JS (e.g., in main.js for revealing content), you may need to inline a simple version or fix the file upload.

Upload Missing Assets Properly
Create folders in your local project if needed:textMyProfile/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   └── js/
│       ├── jquery.min.js     (download from jquery.com)
│       └── main.js           (your custom code)
└── images/
    ├── picb02.jpg
    └── picb03.jpg            (your actual images)
git add . → git commit → git push
Or upload directly via GitHub web interface (Add file → Upload files).

Test & Clear Cache
After push: Visit https://cxcx25.github.io/MyProfile/ and hard refresh (Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R).
Open in Incognito tab to avoid cache.
Check console again — aim for no 404/503 on JS/images.


Expected Outcome After Fix

Text (your name "Joseph Rey C. Marilla", title, summary, nav links like Home/Achievements/Projects) should appear.
Purple background stays (that's fine), but content overlays it once JS runs.

If you paste here the <head> section + all <script> tags from your index.html (or the full file if small), I can tell you exactly which lines to change. Or share the repo link to specific files (e.g., https://github.com/cxcx25/MyProfile/blob/main/index.html) so I can review paths.
