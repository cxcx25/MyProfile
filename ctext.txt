The page at https://cxcx25.github.io/MyProfile/ is still not displaying the expected Hyperspace theme panels/layout (the multi-panel scrolling design with spotlights, sections sliding in, etc.). Instead, it shows only a solid purple/violet background (likely the fallback or body style) with no visible text, panels, or interactive elements.
This is almost always caused by the preloader / initialization logic failing on GitHub Pages, leaving the <body class="is-preload"> (or similar) stuck — Hyperspace hides nearly everything until JS removes the "is-preload" class after loading/animations.
Most Likely Causes (from your setup)

JavaScript critical failure (highest probability)
Hyperspace relies heavily on its assets/js/main.js + util.js + browser.min.js + breakpoints.js to:
Remove is-preload class from body
Initialize scroll/reveal effects
Show panels/sections

If any of these scripts 404 (file not found), has wrong path, or throws a syntax error → the whole init chain breaks → body stays in preload state → content hidden forever.
Your earlier console showed jQuery syntax errors + undefined jQuery → confirms JS is broken early.

Incorrect file paths for GitHub Pages
Local testing (file://) often forgives bad paths.
GitHub Pages is strict: paths must be relative (starting with ./ or no leading /) or full repo-relative.
Common mistakes in Hyperspace forks:HTML<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/main.css" />   ← WRONG (leading / = domain root)
<script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>               ← missing ./   (often fails)Should be:HTML<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/main.css" />
<script src="./assets/js/main.js"></script>

Files not actually committed or in wrong location
From repo inspection: assets/ exists, but many forks have subfolders like assets/css/, assets/js/, assets/sass/, assets/webfonts/.
If you only committed assets/ as empty or partial → 404 on main.css / main.js / util.js.
Hyperspace also needs images/fonts in assets/images/ and assets/webfonts/.

Jekyll interference (if using _config.yml)
Your repo has _config.yml → GitHub thinks it's Jekyll.
Jekyll renames/moves files unless you add include: [assets] or disable processing.
Result: JS/CSS sometimes not served correctly → 404 or empty response.


How to Fix It (Step-by-Step)

Switch to relative paths everywhere
Open index.html
Replace all asset links:
/assets/... → ./assets/...
assets/... → ./assets/... (add dot-slash)

Example full head/scripts block (typical Hyperspace):HTML<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/main.css" />
<!-- ... other css ... -->

<!-- Scripts at bottom -->
<script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/util.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/main.js"></script>

Verify / Re-upload all required files
Download fresh Hyperspace template from https://html5up.net/hyperspace
Copy all files from its assets/ into your repo's assets/ (overwrite).
Especially ensure:
assets/js/main.js exists and has code to do document.body.classList.remove('is-preload');
assets/css/main.css has .is-preload * { ... visibility: hidden ... } or similar hiding rules

Commit + push → wait 1–2 minutes.

Disable Jekyll processing (quick fix)
Add a file called .nojekyll (empty) in the root of repo → commit/push.
This tells GitHub Pages to serve files raw (no Jekyll build) → fixes most asset path issues.

Temporary debug: Remove JS dependency
Comment out all <script> tags except maybe jQuery.
Remove class="is-preload" from <body> manually.
Save → push → check if text appears (ugly but confirms preload is the blocker).
Then re-enable JS one file at a time to find the broken one.

Check browser console after changes
Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5).
Look for 404 on any .js / .css / image.
If you see Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND → path still wrong.
If no errors but still blank → body still has is-preload (inspect element → check <body> classes).


If you paste the current <head> and bottom <script> tags from your index.html (or link to the raw file on GitHub), I can give you the exact lines to change. Alternatively, push the fixes above and share the new console errors — we'll nail it in the next round.
This is a very standard Hyperspace-on-GitHub-Pages trap — once paths + files match and preload removes, the panels will appear.
