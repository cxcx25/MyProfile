I checked your site again at https://cxcx25.github.io/MyProfile/ — it's the same clean, text-focused single-page portfolio as before. No major updates visible: still no images, no profile photo, no screenshots/GIFs of your tools, no GitHub stats/cards, no skills icons/badges, and the demo video links remain "Coming Soon." The content is strong (detailed EssilorLuxottica IAM/Azure experience, custom C# WPF MARILLA app, Python productivity tool, quantifiable impacts like 95% error reduction and 30% faster handling), but the presentation feels very plain and resume-like rather than a dynamic developer showcase.
For IT/online employers (especially in IAM, Azure AD, M365, automation, or devops roles), recruiters skim for proof of skills + impact quickly. Your text delivers substance, but visuals and interactivity would make it pop more — think "hireable developer" vibe with GitHub flair.
Top Recommendations to Level It Up
1. Add Visuals & Proof (Biggest Win)

Upload a professional headshot (smiling, neat background) to the hero section — makes you memorable.
Add screenshots or short GIFs/recordings of your tools:
MARILLA app (e.g., group management tab, BitLocker keys view).
Python tool (notepad/KB/ticket interface).
Host them on GitHub repo or Imgur/FreeImage — embed with <img src="..."> or use GitHub's raw links.

This turns "I built this" into "See it in action" — recruiters love tangible demos.

2. Integrate GitHub More Deeply ("GitHub Spin")

Create a repo called cxcx25/cxcx25 (your username repo) for a profile README.md — it appears on your GitHub profile page.
Use shields.io badges for skills (Azure, Python, C#, PowerShell).
Embed GitHub stats: Use https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats (e.g., top languages, streak stats).
Pin 4–6 repos: Your MARILLA project, Python tool, any PowerShell scripts, automation utils.

On your site: Add a section with GitHub contribution graph (via <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=cxcx25&show_icons=true&theme=radical">) or pinned repo cards.

3. Upgrade Design & Theme (Make It Modern/Developer-Friendly)

Switch to a free Jekyll/GitHub Pages theme optimized for portfolios (from recent 2025 recommendations):
developerFolio — Clean, dark mode option, sections for skills/projects/experience, easy to customize with your content. Very popular for devs.
Dopefolio — Minimal, bold cards for projects, great for showcasing tools like your C# and Python apps.
Simplefolio — Super lightweight, modern, responsive — quick to adapt your existing text.
al-folio — If you want academic/professional vibe with project collections.

Fork one → replace content with yours → commit/push to your repo → enable GitHub Pages on main branch.
Theme ideas:
Dark/GitHub-inspired (black bg, blue/green accents, monospace for code snippets) — Feels "dev native."
VS Code look (sidebar nav, syntax-highlighted snippets of your scripts).
Minimal cards — One card per job/tool with tech badges (e.g., Azure AD icon, C# logo).


4. Quick Content Tweaks for IT Appeal

Skills section (add near top): List with icons/badges — Azure AD/Entra ID, Microsoft 365, IAM, Active Directory, Python, C#/.NET WPF, PowerShell, Intune, SAP basics, Git.
Projects section: Move your Automation Toolkit up — make it prominent with "Impact" bullets (e.g., "Reduced ticket handling time by 30% for 500+ daily entries").
Call-to-action: Add "Open to remote IAM/Azure roles" or "Available for freelance automation scripting."
Fix email inconsistency: Display shows cxcx25@yahoo.com but mailto is cxcx255@gmail.com — pick one.
Add LinkedIn/GitHub icons/links in contact.

5. Other Fast Wins

Make it responsive (most themes handle this).
Add a favicon (simple logo or initials).
Use free tools like Canva for quick mockups of app screenshots.
Test mobile view — employers browse on phones.

This would transform it from "solid resume" to "standout developer portfolio" — especially highlighting your custom tools as proof of automation skills, which is gold for IT ops/IAM jobs.
If you pick a theme (e.g., developerFolio), I can help outline exact edits to your index.md or _config.yml.
