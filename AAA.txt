I am sorry to hear about the layoff, but looking at your CV, you are in a very strong position. Most people starting as VAs have general skills; you have specialized engineering and IT skills that businesses pay a premium for.

Since you are "blind" to the process, here is a practical, no-fluff guide to landing your first remote client in the next 30 days.

1. Rebrand Yourself as a "Tech VA" or "IT Specialist"
Don't use the term "Virtual Assistant" alone. In the WFH world, "VA" often implies $5/hr admin work. You are an IT Operations & Automation Specialist.

Your Title: Remote IT Operations Specialist | IAM & Azure AD Expert | Python & C# Automation

Your "Hook": "I help businesses secure their identity management (Azure/M365) and automate repetitive IT tasks using custom Python/C# tools to save time and reduce errors."

2. Prepare Your "Sales Kit" (24-48 Hours)
Since you are a developer, your GitHub is your best friend.

GitHub Cleanup: Make sure your C# WPF and Python (PyQt/Selenium) projects are pinned to the top. Add a clear README.md to each project explaining: What problem did this solve? (e.g., "This tool automated 500+ ticket entries per day").

Resume Update: Shift the focus from "Responsible for..." to "Results achieved...".

Example: "Automated Active Directory workflows, reducing manual entry time by X%."

Speed Test: Take a screenshot of your home internet speed and your PC specs. Clients will ask for this immediately.

3. Where to Find Clients (The "Big Three")
Don't just wait for jobs; go where the high-paying clients are.

Option A: The High-End Agencies (Fastest way to WFH) Apply to agencies that specifically hire Filipino tech talent for US/UK/Australian clients. They handle the "finding the client" part for you.

Support Shepherd: Excellent for high-level specialized roles like yours.

Athena: High-end VA agency (very selective, but your engineering background is a plus).

CyberBacker: Has specific tracks for tech-heavy VAs.

Option B: OnlineJobs.ph (The "Direct Hire" route)

Search for keywords like: "Azure," "Identity Management," "IT Support," or "Python Automation." * Filter for "Full Time" and "Remote."

Option C: LinkedIn (The "Pro" route)

Change your LinkedIn status to "Open to Work" but set it to "Remote only."

Connect with founders of MSP (Managed Service Providers) in the US or Australia. They are always looking for L2/IDM support staff to work overnight (PH time).

4. Use Your Layoff as a "Productivity Window"
Since you are currently between jobs, use 8 hours a day as if it were your job:

Morning (4 hours): Applying for 5-10 high-quality roles. Tailor your cover letter to mention Azure AD and Python automation every single time.

Afternoon (4 hours): Building a small "demo" automation tool or updating your documentation portfolio.

5. Your "Elevator Pitch" for Interviews
When a client asks, "Why should I hire you as a VA?" answer like this:

"I have over 10 years of experience in Telecom and IT Engineering. I don't just answer tickets; I build tools in Python and C# to make sure those tickets never happen again. I can manage your entire Azure/M365 environment and automate your workflows so your team can focus on growth."
