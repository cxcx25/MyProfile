Current Site Quick Assessment

Content: Very strong. Clear professional headline, detailed experience (especially EssilorLuxottica IAM/Azure work), quantifiable achievements (95% error reduction, 30% faster ticket handling), and highlighted custom tools (C# WPF MARILLA app + Python productivity tool).
Structure: Single-page with Experience, Automation Toolkit, Get in Touch.
Design: Very basic/minimal (typical plain GitHub Pages default). No profile photo, no icons, no project screenshots/GIFs, no GitHub stats, limited visual appeal.
Strengths: Solid technical depth in IAM (Azure AD, M365, AD), automation (Python, C#, PowerShell), and real-world impact — exactly what IT employers want.
Weaknesses: Looks plain, lacks visuals/demos, no skills icons, no GitHub integration (stats, pinned repos, contributions graph), feels more like a resume than a polished portfolio.

Top Ideas to Make It More Appealing to IT Employers
Focus on clarity, visuals, GitHub integration, and proof of skills — recruiters spend ~7 seconds scanning.
1. Visual & Layout Upgrades (Highest Impact)

Add a professional headshot (smiling, business casual) in the hero section.
Switch to dark theme (GitHub-style black/dark gray background + blue accents) — devs love it.
Use card-based layout for Experience and Projects (image on left or top, description + tech badges below).
Add screenshots/GIFs/demos of your MARILLA app and Python tool (even simple screen recordings).
Make it fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

2. Key Sections to Add / Improve

Hero/Header: Short tagline + buttons: "View Projects" | "Download Resume" | "GitHub"
Skills: Icons/badges for Azure AD, Microsoft 365, PowerShell, Python, C#/.NET, WPF, IAM, SAP, Git, etc.
Projects: Dedicated section with 2–4 cards:
MARILLA (C# WPF AD/Azure tool)
Python Productivity/Notepad/KB/Ticket Tool
Include: Live demo link (if hosted), GitHub repo link, tech stack badges, metrics

GitHub Integration (very important for IT roles):
Embed GitHub stats cards (stars, forks, contributions graph)
Show pinned repositories
Latest activity feed

Education & Certifications: Add ArcGIS/ESRI certification, any Azure certs.
Contact: Add LinkedIn, GitHub profile link, location (PH).

3. GitHub-Themed Concepts ("GitHub Spin")

GitHub Dark Mode Clone: Mimic GitHub's UI (repo cards, octocat icon, green contributions graph).
Terminal/Hacker Style: Green text on black background, monospace font, command-line style sections.
VS Code Inspired: Sidebar navigation like VS Code, syntax-highlighted code snippets.
Minimal Clean: White/dark minimal with subtle GitHub octocat accents.
