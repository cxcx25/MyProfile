Good catch — this one is very specific and very common on desktop layouts.
Your image is not broken; it’s being forced into a container that’s taller than the image, and desktop makes that mismatch obvious.

On mobile, the layout stacks → the problem disappears. On desktop, it becomes visible.

Let’s fix it properly.

What’s actually wrong

From the screenshot:

Left column (image) is very tall

The image stays its natural height

The container keeps growing because the right column has a lot of text

Result: huge white space under the image

So the issue is:

❌ Left and right columns are NOT height-synced

✅ Correct fix (do NOT stretch the image)

You want:

Columns same height

Image vertically centered

No distortion

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox at the row level
✅ BEST SOLUTION (Flexbox row)
HTML (example)
<div class="experience-row">
  <div class="experience-image">
    <img src="./images/skec.png" alt="SK Engineering">
  </div>

  <div class="experience-content">
    <!-- your text -->
  </div>
</div>

CSS (this fixes desktop immediately)
.experience-row {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;   /* 🔥 centers image vertically */
}

.experience-image {
  flex: 0 0 320px;       /* fixed column width */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.experience-image img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  object-fit: contain;
}

📱 Mobile (keep what already works)
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .experience-row {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

❌ What NOT to do (causes distortion)
img {
  height: 100%;
}


or

background-size: cover;


This will stretch logos and make them ugly.

Alternative (even cleaner): CSS Grid
.experience-row {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 320px 1fr;
  align-items: center;
}


This is perfect for resume/experience sections.

Why mobile looks fine

Mobile stacks content vertically, so:

No competing heights

No forced alignment

White space disappears naturally

Desktop exposes the layout flaw.

Quick self-check

Open DevTools → select the image container → you’ll see:

height = very large

image only occupies top

That confirms this diagnosis.

Final advice (portfolio polish)

Logos should:

be centered

never stretched

never fill height

be visually balanced with text

Your content is solid — this is purely layout mechanics.
