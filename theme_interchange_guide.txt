# Guide to Interchanging Themes for GitHub Pages

This guide outlines the steps to switch between your 'original-theme' and the 'html5up-dimension' theme for your GitHub Pages site. Remember that GitHub Pages serves the `index.html` and associated assets that are directly in the root of your repository.

**Important Setup (One-Time):**

Ensure your original portfolio files are moved into a subfolder named `original-theme/`. If you haven't done this, execute these commands in your project's root directory:

```powershell
# Create a folder for your original theme
New-Item -Path "original-theme" -ItemType Directory

# Move your original portfolio files into this new folder
# Adjust file/folder names as necessary for your specific original theme
Move-Item -Path "index.html" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "assets" -Destination "original-theme/" -Recurse -Force
Move-Item -Path "images" -Destination "original-theme/" -Recurse -Force
Move-Item -Path "Joseph Rey Marilla.docx" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "Joseph Rey Marilla.pdf" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "aa.txt" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "_config.yml" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "package.json" -Destination "original-theme/" -Force
# Add any other root files from your original portfolio that need to be moved

# Commit and push these organizational changes (optional, but good practice)
git add .
git commit -m "Organized original portfolio into 'original-theme' folder"
git push origin master
```

**How to Switch Between Themes:**

To activate a theme, you need to copy its contents to the root of your repository, then commit and push these changes to GitHub.

**A. To Activate the 'html5up-dimension' Theme:**

1.  **Clear your repository root:** Remove all files and folders that currently represent the active theme from the root directory.
    ```powershell
    # !!! BE CAREFUL: This command deletes files in your root.
    # Ensure your themes are safely backed up in their subfolders. !!!
    Get-ChildItem -Path "." -Exclude "original-theme", "html5up-dimension", ".git", ".gitignore", ".nojekyll", "node_modules" | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Recurse -Force }
    ```
    *(The `-Exclude` part helps prevent accidental deletion of your theme subfolders or Git history)*

2.  **Copy the Dimension theme files to the root:**
    ```powershell
    Copy-Item -Path "html5up-dimension/*" -Destination "./" -Recurse -Force
    ```

3.  **Commit and push these changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Activated html5up-dimension Theme"
    git push origin master
    ```

**B. To Activate Your 'original-theme':**

1.  **Clear your repository root:** Remove all files and folders that currently represent the active theme (Dimension) from the root directory.
    ```powershell
    # !!! BE CAREFUL: This command deletes files in your root.
    # Ensure your themes are safely backed up in their subfolders. !!!
    Get-ChildItem -Path "." -Exclude "original-theme", "html5up-dimension", ".git", ".gitignore", ".nojekyll", "node_modules" | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Recurse -Force }
    ```

2.  **Copy your Original theme files to the root:**
    ```powershell
    Copy-Item -Path "original-theme/*" -Destination "./" -Recurse -Force
    ```

3.  **Commit and push these changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Activated Original Theme"
    git push origin master
    ```
