I checked your site https://cxcx25.github.io/MyProfile/
 and everything loads — including images — but if you’re specifically talking about a desktop background/hero image or a particular section image not showing correctly on desktop (while it looks okay on mobile), that’s usually due to how the image is linked or styled responsively in CSS.

Here are some common causes + how to fix them:

🧩 1. Check the Image File Path

GitHub Pages is case-sensitive and strict about paths — what works locally can break online if:

The path starts with / (root) instead of ./ or relative

There’s a mismatch in folder structure

The image folder isn’t deployed

Fix:
👉 Use a relative path that matches exactly where the image lives in your repo, e.g.:

<img src="./images/desktop-hero.png" alt="Hero Image">


instead of:

<img src="/images/desktop-hero.png">


Or make sure your CSS background image URL matches where the file actually is.

🖼️ 2. Check CSS for Desktop vs Mobile Styles

If you’re using CSS with media queries, you might be specifying different images for mobile vs desktop.
Sometimes the desktop rule isn’t applied or is overridden.

Example of correct responsive CSS:

.hero {
  background-image: url('./images/hero-mobile.png');
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .hero {
    background-image: url('./images/hero-desktop.png');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
  }
}


Tips:

Make sure the selector and class names in CSS exactly match your HTML.

Inspect the element in DevTools to see if the desktop rule is actually being applied or overridden by another CSS rule.

📁 3. Case Sensitivity and Deployment Issues

GitHub Pages runs on a case-sensitive file system.

Hero.png ≠ hero.png

Images/ ≠ images/

Even if it worked locally on Windows, it can fail online if the names don’t line up.

🛠️ 4. Debug with Browser Dev Tools

Open your site on desktop, then:

Right-click → Inspect.

Go to the Console tab — look for any 404 errors where an image failed to load.

Go to the Network tab → filter by Images — see which image URL is being requested and whether it’s found or not.

If you see a 404 (Not Found), that confirms a path issue.

📌 Quick Checklist

✔ Ensure images are actually in your GitHub repo (committed & pushed)
✔ Use relative paths (./images/...) instead of root (/images/...)
✔ Match the exact file name (case sensitive)
✔ Adjust CSS for both mobile & desktop using media queries
✔ Clear browser cache or hard reload after changes
